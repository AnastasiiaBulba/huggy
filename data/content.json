Our music team starts with concept development, creating mood boards and musical sketches that establish the style and atmosphere of each track.

Each track goes through multiple iterations where we test rhythm patterns, difficulty balance, and player engagement. The health mode soundtrack took over two months to perfect, with countless adjustments to tempo, rhythm complexity, and musical progression. We also work closely with our game designers to ensure that each musical element enhances the overall gameplay experience.",
